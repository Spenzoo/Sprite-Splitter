# Sprite-Splitter
Python file that automatically splits up a sprite for you.


**I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE!**
_With 99.9% help from chatgpt because:_
I needed a way to easy split sprites from video games instead of sitting in Photoshop, this does it in basically a second.
Just drag and drop the image onto the python file and type in how many columns in the X and Y axis and it should do the rest.
Works 99% of the time for me and hopefully it will be helpful for someone else.
